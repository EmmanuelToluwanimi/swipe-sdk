```js
const pagination = {
    limit: number, // the number of results to retrieve e.g 5. Default value if not provided is 10.
    offset: number // the number of results to skip e.g 0 or 5. Default value if not provided is 0.
}

swipe.getAllDataTransactions(pagination).then((res) => console.log(res));
```

The Get Data Transaction By Reference method calls the endpoint to get data transaction made by a reference. 

The endpoint can be used to verify the data transactions. The endpoint takes a reference value as a parameter.
